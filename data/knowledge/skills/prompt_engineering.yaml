skill_name: "Prompt Engineering"

definition: |
  The practice of designing, optimizing, and systematizing instructions (prompts) for 
  large language models to achieve desired outputs reliably. Involves techniques like 
  few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, structured output formatting, and 
  iterative refinement. Essential for building production LLM applications where 
  consistency, accuracy, and reliability are critical. Includes prompt templating, 
  versioning, and evaluation.
