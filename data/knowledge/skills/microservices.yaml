skill_name: "Microservices"

definition: |
  Architectural pattern where applications are composed of small, independent services 
  that communicate via APIs. Each microservice handles a specific business capability, 
  can be deployed independently, and uses its own database. Common in cloud-native 
  applications requiring scalability, resilience, and team autonomy.
