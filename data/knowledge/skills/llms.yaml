skill_name: "LLMs (Large Language Models)"

definition: |
  Large Language Models are neural networks trained on vast text corpora to understand 
  and generate human language. Modern LLMs (like GPT-4, Claude, Llama) power conversational 
  AI, code generation, analysis, and reasoning tasks. Working with LLMs involves prompt 
  engineering, API integration, fine-tuning, evaluation, and building applications that 
  leverage their language understanding and generation capabilities. Core to modern AI 
  product development.
