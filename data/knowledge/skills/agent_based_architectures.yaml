skill_name: "Agent-Based Architectures"

definition: |
  Software systems where autonomous agents perform tasks, make decisions, and interact 
  with their environment or other agents. Modern agent-based architectures are prevalent 
  in AI systems where different components (agents) coordinate to solve complex problems. 
  Agents typically have goals, perception capabilities, decision-making logic, and ability 
  to take actions. Common in AI assistants, automated workflows, and intelligent systems 
  that require planning, tool use, and multi-step reasoning.
