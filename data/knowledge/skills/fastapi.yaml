skill_name: "FastAPI"

definition: |
  Modern, high-performance Python web framework for building APIs with automatic 
  validation, documentation, and async support. FastAPI is popular for ML/AI services, 
  microservices, and backend APIs due to its speed, type safety, and developer experience. 
  Built on Starlette and Pydantic, it provides automatic OpenAPI documentation and is 
  ideal for serving ML models, LLM applications, and data-intensive services.
