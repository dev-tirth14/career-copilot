skill_name: "AWS (Amazon Web Services)"

definition: |
  Leading cloud computing platform offering compute, storage, databases, ML services, 
  and more. AWS is essential for deploying scalable applications, ML models, and data 
  pipelines. Key services include EC2 (compute), S3 (storage), Lambda (serverless), 
  RDS (databases), SageMaker (ML), and ECS/EKS (containers). Understanding AWS enables 
  building cloud-native, scalable, and cost-effective applications.
