skill_name: "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)"

definition: |
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a technique that combines information retrieval with 
  large language models to generate more accurate, grounded responses. RAG systems retrieve 
  relevant context from a knowledge base (often using vector databases) and provide it to 
  the LLM to augment its generation. This reduces hallucinations, enables access to private 
  data, and keeps information current without retraining. Essential for building production 
  LLM applications with proprietary knowledge.
