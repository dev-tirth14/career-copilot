skill_name: "Embeddings"

definition: |
  Dense vector representations of data (text, images, code) that capture semantic meaning 
  in high-dimensional space. Embeddings enable machines to understand similarity and 
  relationships between items. Generated by neural networks, embeddings power semantic 
  search, recommendation systems, RAG, and clustering. Working with embeddings involves 
  model selection, dimensionality considerations, normalization, and efficient storage 
  and retrieval in vector databases.
