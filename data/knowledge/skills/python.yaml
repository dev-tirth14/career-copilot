skill_name: "Python"

definition: |
  High-level programming language dominant in AI/ML, data science, and backend development. 
  Python's extensive ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, FastAPI) makes it the 
  primary choice for machine learning and AI applications. Proficiency includes understanding 
  of core language features, async programming, object-oriented design, package management, 
  testing, and Python-specific patterns and best practices.
