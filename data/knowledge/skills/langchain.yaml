skill_name: "LangChain"

definition: |
  Popular Python/TypeScript framework for building applications with large language models. 
  LangChain provides abstractions for chains, agents, memory, retrievers, and prompts, 
  making it easier to build complex LLM workflows. Includes integrations with many LLM 
  providers, vector databases, and tools. Widely used for RAG systems, chatbots, and 
  agent-based applications. Understanding LangChain patterns and architecture is valuable 
  for rapid LLM application development.
