skill_name: "Vector Databases"

definition: |
  Specialized databases optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vector 
  embeddings. Vector databases enable semantic search, similarity matching, and nearest 
  neighbor queries essential for modern AI applications. They index vectors for efficient 
  similarity search (using algorithms like HNSW, IVF) and are fundamental for RAG systems, 
  recommendation engines, and any application requiring semantic understanding rather than 
  exact keyword matching.
