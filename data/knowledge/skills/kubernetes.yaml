skill_name: "Kubernetes"

definition: |
  Open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and 
  management of containerized applications. Kubernetes (K8s) is the industry standard for 
  running containers in production, providing features like auto-scaling, self-healing, 
  service discovery, and load balancing. Essential for microservices, ML model serving, 
  and cloud-native applications at scale.
