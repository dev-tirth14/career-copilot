skill_name: "Docker"

definition: |
  Containerization platform for packaging applications with their dependencies into 
  portable, isolated containers. Docker enables consistent deployment across environments, 
  simplifies dependency management, and is foundational for microservices, CI/CD pipelines, 
  and cloud deployment. Essential for modern software development and deployment, 
  particularly for ML/AI applications that require specific environments and dependencies.
