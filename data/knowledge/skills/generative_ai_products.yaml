skill_name: "Generative AI Products"

definition: |
  Production applications that leverage generative AI (particularly LLMs) to create 
  content, assist users, or automate workflows. These are end-to-end AI products with 
  user interfaces, backend systems, and production deployment. Examples include chatbots, 
  AI assistants, code copilots, content generators, and intelligent automation tools. 
  Building generative AI products requires combining LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG, 
  user experience design, and production engineering.
