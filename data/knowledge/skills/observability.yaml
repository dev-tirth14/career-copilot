skill_name: "Observability"

definition: |
  Practice of instrumenting systems to understand their internal state through metrics, 
  logs, and traces. Observability enables debugging, performance optimization, and 
  reliability monitoring in production systems. For AI/ML, includes tracking model 
  performance, token usage, latency, errors, and user interactions.
