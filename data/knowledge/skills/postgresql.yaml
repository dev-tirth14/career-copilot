skill_name: "PostgreSQL"

definition: |
  Advanced open-source relational database system known for reliability, data integrity, 
  and extensibility. PostgreSQL supports complex queries, transactions, JSON, and with 
  extensions like pgvector, enables vector similarity search for AI applications. Widely 
  used for production applications requiring ACID compliance, complex data relationships, 
  and advanced features like full-text search, spatial data, and time-series data.
