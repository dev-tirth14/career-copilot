  RAW JOB POSTING:
  {job_content}

  EXTRACT THESE THREE FIELDS:

  1. DESCRIPTION
     - Create a concise summary (3-5 sentences) of what the role involves
     - Focus on: main responsibilities, team/department, business impact
     - Include the business context (what product/service/domain the team supports)
     - Mention the type of problems they solve (e.g., search optimization, NLP, forecasting)
     - Do NOT just list bullet points - synthesize into a coherent summary
     - Ignore: company marketing, benefits, perks, equal opportunity statements, application instructions

  2. REQUIREMENTS
     - Extract ALL technical and professional requirements as a comma-separated list
     - MUST include (if mentioned):
       * Education: degrees, fields of study (e.g., "Bachelor's in Computer Science", "Master's in Mathematics")
       * Experience: years required (e.g., "3+ years experience", "5+ years in ML")
       * Programming languages: Python, Java, Scala, SQL, R, etc.
       * ML/AI frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
       * Data tools: Spark, Pandas, Numpy, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka
       * Cloud platforms: GCP, AWS, Azure, Vertex AI, BigQuery, SageMaker
       * AI/ML skills: NLP, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, RAG, LLMs, Transformers, Embeddings
       * Databases: SQL, NoSQL, Vector databases, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
       * DevOps/MLOps: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, MLflow
       * Soft skills: communication, collaboration, problem-solving (if emphasized)
     - Include BOTH required AND nice-to-have/preferred qualifications
     - Extract skills mentioned in job duties too (e.g., "build RAG pipelines" means RAG is required)
     - Be EXHAUSTIVE - this is critical for job matching accuracy
     - Separate items with commas, no bullet points

  3. KEY_TECHNOLOGIES
     - Extract the TOP 10 most critical technologies for this specific role
     - Prioritize: primary programming language, main ML framework, cloud platform, specialized tools
     - These are the "must-have" skills that define the role
     - Order by importance (most important first)
     - Comma-separated list

  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  Return a complete, valid JSON object. Must start with {{ and end with }}.

  EXACTLY this structure:
  {{"description": "your summary here", "requirements": "comprehensive comma-separated list here", "key_technologies": "top 10 technologies here"}}

  CRITICAL RULES:
  - Return ONLY the JSON object - no other text
  - Must be valid JSON parseable by Python's json.loads()
  - All three fields are REQUIRED - use empty string "" only if truly no information
  - No markdown code blocks (no ```)
  - No line breaks inside string values
  - No trailing commas
